[{"content":" The practical and approachable guide for curious engineers, hackers, and security researchers.\nWhy Reverse Engineering \u0026amp; Hardware Hacking? Reverse Engineering and Hardware Hacking both sound extremely daunting spaces. They often have extremely steep learning curves and require technical expertise in a wide variety of subjects.\nHowever, I\u0026rsquo;m here to tell you today that whether you have a broad curiosity for these fields or have niche interests in vulnerability research, firmware analysis, or learning how embedded systems work under the hood, this field will always keep you learning.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need a PhD, expensive equipment, or prior exposure- just patience and a structured approach.\nMindset First Approach Before intentionally tripping into the, \u0026ldquo;I need to buy all of these cool tools!\u0026rdquo; Try to look into the free alternatives to get started. Start with some good ol\u0026rsquo; application analysis using free tools like Binwalk, Ghidra, and a good hex editor.\nThere are tons of firmware packages out on the open internet that are often uncompressed, unobfuscated, and unencrypted. These firmware packages can be found off the given devices updating download page website.\nSecondly, approach your projects with a goal. It can be as simple as: \u0026ldquo;I want to get better at Vulnerability Research.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I want to better understand how embedded Linux practically works.\u0026rdquo;\nLastly, adopt the right mindset:\nSlow is Smooth- rushing rabbit holes to missed details causes confusion Document Everything- notes are just as important as the vulnerabilities Read The F###### Manuals- RTFM, just live by it, a lot of devices you start as projects and their subcomponents are often well documented\u0026hellip; (until they aren\u0026rsquo;t) A High-level Step-by-Step Approach Pick an easy target While it may be tempting to chase after the big dogs, they usually pack a much larger punch to get into, so please pick something simple.\nGreat Beginner Targets\nOld/Cheap Routers Old/Cheap IP Cameras Network Printers Essential Hardware Tools (Minimalistic) Choosing the right tools can get you surprisingly far in a project, so picking wisely can both save you money and be less annoying.\nMust-Have USB-to-TTL Serial Adapter (3.3V) Multimeter Jumper Wires (male-to-male, male-to-female) Soldering Iron (and supplementals like solder, flux, etc.) Nice-to-Have\u0026rsquo;s Universal Programmer (XGecu) Hot Air Station Tip: Choosing a nicer Soldering Iron is ok here, as this is comparable to your power tools at home.
